I build AI systems where the model isn't a feature bolted on top — it's the core of what the product does. My work spans generative game engines, assistive technology for dementia care, multi-agent LLM pipelines, and responsible AI research. I care about systems that are both technically interesting and genuinely useful.

Currently exploring multi-agent architectures, real-time generative applications, and the intersection of AI safety with production engineering.

## Featured Projects

### [Defeat the Darkness](https://github.com/gamefreakoneone/all-your-base-is-ours) — AI Game Director
`TypeScript` `React` `Gemini 3` `Vercel Serverless`

A browser-based beat-em-up where every visual asset is generated in real time. Players sketch their hero on a canvas, describe their fears, and Gemini 3 transforms the sketch into animated pixel-art sprites and spawns enemies from their imagination. The final boss runs on the Gemini Live API — it taunts you through the speakers and responds to voice in real time. No pre-made assets exist; every playthrough is unique.

The architecture uses three distinct Gemini 3 capabilities: native image generation for sprites and backgrounds, structured JSON output for an LLM-as-a-Judge validation pipeline (score ≥ 70 to pass, with automatic retry and fallback), and the Live API for real-time voice-driven boss combat with function-call-tiered damage.

### [Where We Left Off](https://github.com/gamefreakoneone/Where-we-left-off-reader) — AI Reading Companion
`Python` `TypeScript` `Next.js 15` `FastAPI` `LangGraph` `ChromaDB`

An AI-powered reading companion that tracks a book's narrative as you read it. Upload any PDF, and the system runs a two-pass analysis: first extracting per-chapter characters, relationships, and summaries; then consolidating entities across chapters with canonical ID resolution. A spoiler-safe RAG system answers questions about the story — but only based on what you've already read. Character relationship graphs update in real time as you progress.

---

### [Memoria](https://github.com/gamefreakoneone/Project-Memoria_Dementia-Assistant) — Dementia Assistant
`Python` `YOLOv11` `Computer Vision` `Conversational AI` `MongoDB`

An intelligent assistance system built to improve safety and quality of life for dementia patients. Combines a custom YOLOv11 fall-detection model with a conversational agent that answers questions like "Have I eaten lunch?" or "Where did I leave my keys?" using time-stamped event logs stored in MongoDB. The system monitors for falls, sends email alerts, and maintains an activity recall memory.

---

### [VigilMind](https://github.com/gamefreakoneone/VigilMind) — AI Parental Supervision
`Python` `Flask` `React` `MongoDB` `OpenAI`

A comprehensive parental control platform with three integrated components: a desktop monitoring agent with AI-powered content analysis, a React dashboard for configuration and activity review, and a browser extension for web content monitoring. Features real-time screenshot analysis, application blocking, and an appeal handling system.

---

### [Ctrl-Alt-Del-Hate](https://github.com/gamefreakoneone/Ctrl-Alt-Del-Hate) — Hate Speech Detection
`Python` `Gemma` `Llama` `Hugging Face` `LLM Fine-tuning`

Fine-tuned Gemma and Llama models on hate speech datasets, with comprehensive benchmarking across accuracy and explainability metrics. Includes few-shot learning experiments and structured evaluation comparing model generations. The goal: detection that doesn't just classify, but explains.

---

### [FIRM — Stock Watch](https://github.com/anuragmudgil0699/FIRM) — NLP Forecasting *(Contributor)*
`Python` `RAG` `NLP` `Transformers`

Collaborative NLP research project. Built a retrieval-augmented language model system that forecasts stock market direction using news articles, Twitter posts, SEC filings, and historical price data. Achieved **72% accuracy** and **0.67 F1 score**. Presented as part of NLP coursework, 2024.
